\subsubsection{Venue}
A venue will have to have a contact detail field and it could be of a certain type. Hence we make use of the strategy pattern and enable the user to add any type of contact information, that UPRM supports, to which submissions will be sent. How the Contact class is structured will be up up for the developer to choose.\\ \\
