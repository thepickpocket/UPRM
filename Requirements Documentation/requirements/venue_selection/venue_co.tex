\subsubsection{Venue}
A venue will have to have a contact detail field and it could be of a certain type. Hence we make use of the strategy pattern and enable the user to add any type of contact information, that UPRM supports, to which submissions will be sent. How the Contact class is structured will be decided based on the notification types of UPRM. The Contact class should at least have functionality for a mobile number and email address.\\ \\
