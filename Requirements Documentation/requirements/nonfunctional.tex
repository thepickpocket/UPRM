\subsubsection{Performance}
For UPRM performance will not be a core non-functional requirement, however to make the system feasible and usable the following requirements must hold:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The response time of any query should be \textless{}  5 seconds.
	\item The generation of any report or statistic should be at most 10 seconds.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reliability}

\subsubsection{Availability}

\subsubsection{Security}
Security is one of the most significant non-functional requirements as the data that is processed and stored by UPRM is of a sensitive nature. 
A vast amount of research ideas and the progress status on current research will be stored by UPRM needless to say, if such data falls into the wrong hands it could jeopardise the research project or the idea of the research.\\ 

\textbf{In terms of security}, UPRM should,
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item never reveal the current progress of research projects to unauthorized parties.
		\item never reveal future research ideas to unauthorized parties.
		\item prevent the loss of any data (personal and research related data).
	\end{itemize}

\textbf{In terms of security requirements}, UPRM should,
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item make use of strong passwords.
		\item utilise two step verification.
		\item make sure that password resets is done by an administrator.
	\end{itemize}
