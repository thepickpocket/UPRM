\subsubsection{Authentication and User}
The authentication class will have login, logout, register user and get session operations. An instance of authentication will hold the current user session.\\ \\
Since third party users should be able to register we need a user class to store the user details. Each private attribute needs a getter function to be able to get the user data for registration.\\ \\
