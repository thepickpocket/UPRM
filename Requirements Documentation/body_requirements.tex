		Any and all input should be checked to be valid before sending it to the UPRM server.

	\subsection{Logical Database Requirements}
		All data being used by the UPRM system, and its sub-systems, will be stored in a database managed by a DBMS. Although a relational database can be used, an object-relational database will be better. The UPRM database will have to have four tables:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Venue} - For storing all information regarding a specific venue.
			\item \textbf{Project} - For storing all project related information.
			\item \textbf{TPUsers} - For storing access information of third party users.
			\item \textbf{Submissions} - For storing feedback and submission statusses of projects to venues.
		\end{itemize}
		The following diagram shows the basic database layout for the UPRM database. Do note that the structure of the database is likely to change during development and thus this diagram is simply given as a guideline.\\ \\
		In the pictures shown below the following data types are represented in the following way:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{" "} - String.
			\item \textbf{Numbers} - Integers.
			\item \textbf{TRUE/FALSE} - Boolean.
			\item \textbf{nn/nn/nnnn} - where n is a numerical digit, it signifies LocalDate.
			\item \textbf{Other} - Wherever there are fields that do not match the above data types, then an Enumeration type will be used for example in the \emph{VenueType} field.\\
		\end{itemize}

		The submissions table will be used to store all the information of a project once it has been submitted to a venue for review.\\ \\

		The UPRM system has the following data retention policy: \emph{Data will always be kept unless explicitly removed by an administrator or a user that has been given the right permissions.}
		Projects that have been marked as complete, will be moved to another database used for legacy purposes. Thus meaning that statistics can be more accurately gathered and more accurate predictions can be made.
		The legacy project table will have exactly the same fields as the Project table.
